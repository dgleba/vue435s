     * How to use Event Listeners:
     * 
     * It requires 2 steps:
     * 1) We fetch the object. We need to retrieve the object from the DOM by using a document retriever. 
     * 
     * These methods are: 
     * document.getElementById()
     * document.querySelector() -- Similar to jQuery
     * document.querySelectorAll()
     * document.getElementsByClassName()
     * document.getElementsByName()
     * document.getElementsByTagName()
     * document.getElementsByTagNameNS()
     * 
     * There are more advance uses of these "retrievers", but let's keep it simple. 
     * 
     * 2) We attach the event listener:
     * We need to store the retrieved element in a variable (recommended).
     * 
     * const element = document.querySelector('button');
     * 
     * Then we attach the event listener:
     * element.addEventListener('click', myFunction);
     * 
     * Whereas myFunction is the function (without parenthesis!! Otherwise it executes it!!) that
     * you want to call. 
     * 
     * See this as the equivalent of:
     * <button click="myFunction()">My Button</button>
     * 
     * You can see the event listener list in the panel at the left in MDN:
     * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener
     *
